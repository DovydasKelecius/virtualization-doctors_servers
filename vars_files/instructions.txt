1. Create vault_password.sh in repo directory with execute permissions.
change your password and make sure this file will be kept local (not pushed into git). 
This vault_password will only manage your vault encryption, so you can put in whatever you want, but keep it if you'll want to change it.

vault_password.sh:

#!/bin/bash
echo "my_secret_password"



2. Inside your dedicated variable files in ./vars_files/vault_pass_(xxxxx).yml insert your data for OpenNebula
Andrius - webserver
Julius	- client
Justas	- db

3. Then run this command (with your files and specified id) to encrypt your file.

ID is the same as the file name just without .yml extension

Example for me (who is responsible for ansible):
			<ID>	    <Action>	<vault location>
./manage_vault.sh vault_pass_ansible encrypt ./vars_files/vault_pass_ansible.yml

4. Once you made sure the file is encrypted. Push it in git, and make sure vault_password.sh is not pushed.
